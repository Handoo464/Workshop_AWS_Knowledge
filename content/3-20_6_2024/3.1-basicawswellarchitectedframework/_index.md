[What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework? (and why you need to learn about it) (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpDJ6TCWKjk&t=483s)

AWS WELL ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK, to put it simply, is a set of strategies and guidelines for designing and running workloads in the cloud; it's created by AWS and provides a framework to help Cloud Architects build resilient architectures. Now, this framework doesn't just provide you with a list of do's and don'ts; instead, it gives you a blueprint and guideline for building resilient, scalable, and secure applications and workloads, essentially taking the guesswork out of building things in the cloud. It also provides a consistent approach for AWS customers and partners to evaluate their architectures; this helps them create designs that will scale with application designs over time.
